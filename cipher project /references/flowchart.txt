step1 —> letter counts	
step2 —> Find e and replace it 						SOLVE “E”
step3 —> produce bigram tables
step4 —> produce trigram tables
step5 —> produce 4grams tables
step6 —> the most common trigram should be “the”			SOLVE “H” and “T”

step7 —> most frequent eXt == ‘ent’					SOLVE ’N’
step8 —> compare 4grams to find out “that” 				SOLVE “A”
step9 —> compare trigrams to find “and” 				SOLVE “D”
step10 —> compare bigrams to find “re”		(lowercase)+”e”		SOLVE “R”
step11 —> compare bigrams to find “or”		(lowercase)+”r”		SOLVE “O”
step12 —> compare bigrams to find “in”		(lowercase)+”n”		SOLVE “I”




step11 —> only character in letter counts but not in bigrams list 	SOLVE “S”
